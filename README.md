## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a bit of a tricky challenge because it was the first time I had properly worked with querySelectorAll, and forEach so I wasn't entirely sure what to do. Thankfully there's a lot of information online, and after a few trials and errors, I was able to get the functionality down.
### Continued development

I need to practice my animations/transitions/transformations, because I feel like the end result would look better when transitioning between the testimonials. This is something that I'll practice in the future.
